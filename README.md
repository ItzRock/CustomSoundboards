# Custom Soundboards
![Logo](https://github.com/ItzRock/CustomSoundboards/blob/main/icon.png)

Custom Soundboards allow you to play audio.


[GitHub](https://github.com/ItzRock/CustomSoundboards), [Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/c/content-warning/p/AnthonyStai/CustomSoundboards/)

## Instructions
1. Install the mod through Thunderstore and launch the game to generate the config.
2. Find any audio on a website which hosts audio (Such as [My Instants](https://www.myinstants.com/))
3. Get the download URL for the audio which should end in a file extension such as .mp3, .wav, .ogg (If you open the URL it should automatically try to download it, that means thats the correct url.)
4. Go to your configuration for Custom Soundboards and add it to the beginning of the string and append a comma afterwards. (For example `https://example.com/audio1.mp3,https://example.com/audio2.mp3,...`)
5. Save the configuration and launch the game. (Everyone who you play with needs to install the mod and have the same configuration in order to hear the audio)
6. Play your horrific sounds.
